# Final-Project---Voting-Analysis
This is the final project for my Introduction to Data Science course exploring the correlation between income earnings and voting outcomes based on government data.

The main questions explored in this analysis focused on the income earnings data for electoral districts and compared this to election results data for that same year.

Methods used in this project include: KNN Nearest Neighbours Regression and Bootstrapping with Test and Training split data to ensure more objectivity in the data.

The preferred visualizations were in the form of a layered line graph on top of a scatter plot to better understand the trends in voting overlaid on the income distribution
